# Chess3D

Play chess in 3D! Simulates a full chess game with another (human) player. Made using Java and LWJGL.

My lightweight game/rendering engine supports:
* Loading meshes from OBJ files
* Applying shaders for textures and lighting
* Position/rotation/scale transformations
* Camera movement
* Line ray-tracing
